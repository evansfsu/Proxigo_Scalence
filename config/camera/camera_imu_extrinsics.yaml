# Camera-IMU Extrinsic Calibration
# Transform from IMU frame to Camera frame
#
# IMPORTANT: These values MUST be calibrated for your specific setup
# Use Kalibr or similar tool for accurate calibration
#
# Coordinate frames:
#   IMU frame: x-forward, y-left, z-up (NWU convention)
#   Camera frame: z-forward, x-right, y-down (optical convention)

# Transformation matrix T_imu_cam (4x4 homogeneous)
# Transforms points from camera frame to IMU frame
# p_imu = T_imu_cam * p_cam
T_imu_cam:
  # Rotation (camera optical to IMU body)
  # This example assumes camera pointing forward, mounted level
  rotation:
    # Rotation matrix (row-major)
    # Camera z-forward → IMU x-forward
    # Camera x-right → IMU y-left (negated)  
    # Camera y-down → IMU z-up (negated)
    - [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]   # IMU x = Camera z
    - [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # IMU y = -Camera x
    - [0.0, -1.0, 0.0]  # IMU z = -Camera y
  
  # Translation (meters) - camera position relative to IMU
  translation:
    x: 0.05   # Camera 5cm forward of IMU
    y: 0.0    # Camera centered laterally
    z: 0.02   # Camera 2cm above IMU
    
# Alternative: Quaternion representation
T_imu_cam_quaternion:
  # Quaternion (w, x, y, z)
  qw: 0.5
  qx: -0.5
  qy: 0.5
  qz: -0.5
  # Translation
  tx: 0.05
  ty: 0.0
  tz: 0.02

# Time offset (camera timestamp - IMU timestamp)
# Positive means camera images are timestamped later than IMU
# Typically needs calibration, start with 0 and refine
timeshift_cam_imu: 0.0  # seconds

# Calibration metadata
